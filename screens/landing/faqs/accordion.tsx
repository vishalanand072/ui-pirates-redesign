    list: [
      "‚Ü≥ Design-Only: This service focuses solely on the visual and user experience aspects. We provide wireframes, UI/UX design, branding, and interactive prototypes, ready for handoff to your development team. This is perfect if you have a development team in place and need design assets to start the build.",
      "‚Ü≥ Dev-Only: In this option, we handle the development based on your existing designs. Our team turns your design files into a live product, focusing on coding, testing, and deployment. This is ideal if you already have finalized designs and only need expert developers to bring them to life.",
      "‚Ü≥ Design + Development: This end-to-end option combines both services, taking your project from concept to a fully functional product. We manage the design, coding, testing, and launch, ensuring a seamless transition from visuals to a live website or app. Choose this option if you want a one-stop solution from our team, covering all aspects of your project.",

      "‚Ü≥ Fixed Pricing: Best if you have a well-defined project scope and prefer upfront budgeting. This option allows for a set cost for the entire project, helping with predictable expenses. Typically includes limited iterations to keep the timeline focused.",

      "üìç Example: If you need a landing page with multiple illustrations and animations, fixed pricing gives you a clear cost up front, while hourly pricing lets you add features as we go.",
