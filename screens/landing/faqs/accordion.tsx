    title1: "Each option caters to different project needs and stages:",
    list: [
      "↳ Design-Only: This service focuses solely on the visual and user experience aspects. We provide wireframes, UI/UX design, branding, and interactive prototypes, ready for handoff to your development team. This is perfect if you have a development team in place and need design assets to start the build.",
      "↳ Dev-Only: In this option, we handle the development based on your existing designs. Our team turns your design files into a live product, focusing on coding, testing, and deployment. This is ideal if you already have finalized designs and only need expert developers to bring them to life.",
      "↳ Design + Development: This end-to-end option combines both services, taking your project from concept to a fully functional product. We manage the design, coding, testing, and launch, ensuring a seamless transition from visuals to a live website or app. Choose this option if you want a one-stop solution from our team, covering all aspects of your project.",
    ],
    title2:

    title1: "It depends on how you want to manage the project:",
    list: [
      "↳ Hourly Pricing: Flexible, ideal if you need more control over ongoing costs. You pay only for the hours used, and it’s perfect for projects that might change or grow in scope. Adjustments and extra work are billed transparently on an hourly basis.",
      "↳ Fixed Pricing: Best if you have a well-defined project scope and prefer upfront budgeting. This option allows for a set cost for the entire project, helping with predictable expenses. Typically includes limited iterations to keep the timeline focused.",
    ],
    title2:
      "📍 Example: If you need a landing page with multiple illustrations and animations, fixed pricing gives you a clear cost up front, while hourly pricing lets you add features as we go.",

    title1:
      "It depends on the project’s scope, desired flexibility, and timeline.",
    list: [
      "↳ Fixed Pricing: Suitable for well-defined projects with a clear start and end, like landing pages or simple web apps. It’s easier to budget and track, with fewer variables.",
      "↳ Hourly Pricing: Ideal if you need to adapt the scope as you go or want regular iterations. Perfect for complex projects with evolving requirements.",

    list: [

      "•	Web & Mobile Apps: Typically span 1-3 months, allowing for testing, user feedback, and adjustments.",
      "•	Comprehensive Design Systems: Around 1-2 months, as they require in-depth planning, component library setup, and testing.",
